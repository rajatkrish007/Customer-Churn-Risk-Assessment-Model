# Customer Churn Risk Assessment Model
#
## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on assessing customer churn risk through data analysis and machine learning. This project was assigned as part of an online job simulation internship by BCG Gamma, providing participants with a real-world experience in data science applications. The primary objective is to analyze customer data to predict the likelihood of churn, enabling businesses to identify at-risk customers and implement proactive retention strategies. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques, the project aims to improve customer satisfaction and drive business growth.

#
## Project Structure
The project is organized into several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis:

- **Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb**: Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its features.
- **Feature_Selection.ipynb**: Performs feature selection to identify the most significant predictors of customer churn.
- **Model_Development.ipynb**: Involves training and evaluating various machine learning models to assess customer churn risk.
#
## Getting Started
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
#
### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rajatkrish007/Customer-Churn-Risk-Assessment-Model.git
   cd Customer-Churn-Risk-Assessment-Model

2. Install the required packages:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks to begin your analysis:
      jupyter notebook
#
## Dataset
The project utilizes the following datasets:

- **Client_data.csv**: Contains demographic and behavioral information about customers.
- **Price_data.csv**: Includes pricing information relevant to customer behavior.
- **data_for_predictions.csv**: The dataset used for making predictions based on the trained models.
#
## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns that may indicate churn.
2. **Feature Selection**: Utilize techniques to select the most relevant features that contribute to customer churn predictions.
3. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to predict churn risk and assess their performance.
#
## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective churn prediction.
#
## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of customer churn risk, enabling businesses to develop targeted retention strategies. The insights gained from this analysis can help in improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates.
#
## Future Scope
- **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features such as customer engagement metrics and external market data to improve model accuracy.
- **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Experiment with ensemble methods and deep learning algorithms to enhance predictive performance.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Implement a system for real-time churn predictions to facilitate timely interventions for at-risk customers.
- **Deployment**: Consider deploying the model as a web application to make it accessible for businesses to utilize in their decision-making processes.
